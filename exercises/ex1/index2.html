	<p>
		The series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby, who narrates the story of how he met the mother of his children.
		While the traditional love story structure begins when the <br>romantic leads first encounter each other, How I Met
		Your Mother does not introduce Ted's wife until the eighth-season finale and only announces her name.
